# SIMULATIONS RESULTS  

## General_Results  
This file contains the QMI, SDF and NTM of 30 simulation in the scenario without no fly zones.     

## noFlyZones
This file contains the QMI, SDF and NTM of 30 simulation for the 3 scenarios with no fly zones.  

## All Spreeadsheets  
This foldes contains the spreeadsheets for all the simulation for the scenario without no fly zone. We divided in two, first all the simulation with empiric values and in the GA folder all simulations using the GA generated parameters.
