The  test  platform  was  built  using  the  PyGame  library[28].  The  scenario  is  a50Ã—50grid  containing  four  UAVsmodeled as robot-agents. We present four types of scenarios,one  free  of  obstacles  and  other  three  containing  differentcompositions  of  no-fly  zones  (NFZ).  The  aerial  robots  cannavigate through the scenario, interact with each other, andavoid  the  NFZ.  The  starting  position  of  the  UAVs  is  at  thelower-left corner of the scenario.
